# S25-STATS-199-Shiny-App

The `shiny app` folder contains the three files:
 - `ui.R`
 - `server.R`
 - `global.R `

 I've implemented a very simple one-proportion test (two-sided) which just shows the user the R output of the prop.test() function. It's not very useful at the moment. 

 I've added it under a tab panel, but I think adding more tests as tab panels could get messy very fast. I think before we start, we can brainstorm a better overall UI from a top-level, like Thomas suggested, and make a list/flowchart of everything we want to include.
